## Contributing to code base

Do you want to change the functionality or just fix a typo? Let's get into it! Fork this repository, update the code and submit the pull request.

## Documentation

Would you document the feature or config option better? That's great. Just switch to [documentation repository](https://gitlab.com/hajnyon/middleman-uikit-documentation-demo) and contribute here. FYI the repositories are separated to demonstrate the GitLab Static Site Editor - that can be used to contribute! Just navigate to documentation [website](https://hajnyon.gitlab.io/middleman-uikit-documentation-demo/), switch to page you want to edit, click **Edit this page** and after GitLab signing you can edit the content in a wysiwyg editor.
